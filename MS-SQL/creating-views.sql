-- Views are good for restricting rows and columns for users, like a mask over the data.

-- Creating views
select 1
go
create view ViewByDepartment as 
select D.Department, T.EmployeeNumber, T.DateOfTransaction, T.Amount as TotalAmount
from tblDepartment as D
left join tblEmployee as E
on D.Department = E.Department
left join tblTransaction as T
on E.EmployeeNumber = T.EmployeeNumber
where T.EmployeeNumber between 120 and 139
-- use top(100) percent to be able to use order in View
order by D.Department, T.EmployeeNumber
go

create view ViewSummary as 
select D.Department, T.EmployeeNumber as EmpNum, sum(T.Amount) as TotalAmount
